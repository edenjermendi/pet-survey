# Pet Survey

Hi, I’m eden

This is my **first solo HTML and CSS project**: a simple pet survey page. It was built as part of my learning journey to practice basic HTML forms, styling, and page structure.

---

## What It Does

- Gathers basic information from users (name, email, phone)
- Collects details about their pets:
  - Pet’s name and age
  - Type of pet (dog, cat, bird, etc.)
  - Living environment (indoor/outdoor/both)
  - Sleep habits (diurnal/nocturnal)
  - Extra personality notes

It’s all styled with CSS for a consistent look and custom checkbox/radio buttons.

## My Learning Goals

This project helped me practice:

- Structuring HTML forms semantically
- Using CSS flexbox for layout
- Styling form elements
- Organizing styles into manageable blocks
- Working with custom inputs (checkboxes, radios, etc.)

---

## Future Plans

I’m planning to come back to this project to:

- Add mild interactivity with JavaScript
- Implement better form validation
- Improve layout with flexbox and grid
- Enhance responsiveness for smaller screens
- Add animations or visual polish

## My Coding Journey

This was my first solo attempt at putting together a page without step-by-step instructions. It’s definitely not perfect, but I’m proud of how far I’ve come — and excited to keep improving it with everything I’ve learned about layout, interactivity, and cleaner code.

Thanks for checking it out!
